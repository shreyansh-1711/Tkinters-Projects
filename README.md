# Tkinters-Projects

 This repository includes several small Tkinter examples according to the book Tkinter GUI Application Development.
 All Of Them are made using Python-3 and tkinter Module
 This is a collection of .py Python projects created using the TKinter library.

Tkinter-animation.py is a simple animation created using solely polygonal coordinates and RGB manipulation, displaying a scene with a piano player in the foreground and weather cycling between sunny and rainy through the window in the background. Color gradients were also used to alter lighting effects.

Tkinter-Tron-GUI.py is a game created in a similar fashion to the previous program. This allows two players to interact with Tron bikes using the AWSD and IJKL keys, respectively. Each player receives points for causing the other player to either run into a wall or collide with one of the generated color trails. An invinsibility powerup also exists, randomly generated on a timer as a strobing circle that either player can collide with to activate.
